I have developed a robust and secure note-taking application using C# as the programming language and Supabase as the backend. The application was built with Windows Forms App in Visual Studio, using the .NET Framework. This gives users the option to log in with an email and password or register to access the application.

The note-taking app allows users to create and edit notes in an easy and intuitive way. All notes are saved in the Supabase database, ensuring the security of the information by encrypting the notes. Via email and password authentication, users have private and personalized access to their notes.

The app's user-friendly interface offers advanced functionality, including creating new notes and editing existing notes.

Using modern and secure technologies like Supabase, I have ensured a secure environment for storing and managing grades. The app has been developed with attention to detail, ensuring a smooth user experience and solid protection of personal data.
