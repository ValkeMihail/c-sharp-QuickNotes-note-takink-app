# c-sharp-QuickNotes-note-taking-app
I have developed a robust and secure note-taking application using C# as the programming language and Supabase as the backend. The application was built with Windows Forms App in Visual Studio, using the .NET Framework. This gives users the option to log in with an email and password or register to access the application.
The note-taking app allows users to create and edit notes in an easy and intuitive way. All notes are saved in the Supabase database, ensuring the security of the information by encrypting the notes.
## Technologies used:
